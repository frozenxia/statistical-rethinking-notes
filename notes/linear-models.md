Namely, independent and identically distributed, or shortly iid. The term 'iid' indicates that $h_i$ has the same probability function, independent of other h and using the same parameter.


### de Finetti’s theorem

Values that can be approximated by mixtures of i.i.d distribution if they a exchangeable.

### Ontological, Epistemological, Methodological

- Ontological(本体论) assumption concerns on the nature of world and human being in social context. There are different assumptions to see the world as outside individual. Therefore, ontology in normative emphasis that social phenomenon is independent from other factors.

- Epistemological(认识论) assumption refers to the ways to acquire the knowledge, the knowledge those are acceptable in certain paradim. For example, epistemological in the normative paradim is how the social world can investigate as nature science. Hypotheses have to test by empirical approaches.
